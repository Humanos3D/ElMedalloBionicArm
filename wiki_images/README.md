This directory stores images that we want to use in the wiki.  It is useful to store images here as we can upload them via the web and then refer to them directly in the wiki.

For example, we can reference and display the example file as shown below using the markdown format

`![](https://github.com/enable-medellin/general/blob/master/wiki_images/blue_enable_logo.png)`

![](https://github.com/enable-medellin/general/blob/master/wiki_images/blue_enable_logo.png)

Or we can use html to get some additional control (e.g., scaling)

`<img src="https://github.com/enable-medellin/general/blob/master/wiki_images/blue_enable_logo.png" width="100">`

<img src="https://github.com/enable-medellin/general/blob/master/wiki_images/blue_enable_logo.png" width="100">
